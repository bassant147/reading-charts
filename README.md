## This project was created by create-react-app, and the backend was created with JSON-server.

#### Available scripts - *npm must be installed first*

#### 1- For setup, This command will install all modules listed as dependencies in project. Open project directory and type: *npm install*
#### 2- The following script runs both the frontend and backend servers *concurrently*:  &nbsp; *npm run dev* 

---

### Please note the following:

1- Bug Alert:  There is an undesired behavior whenever the user selects owned posts over time, it is an issue with id that I will solve and commit later but I wanted to commit the code before changing the logic. The other two charts are working as expected. *I am planning to work on this bug tomorrow*

2- The UI menu is functional but doesn't look pretty.

3- Using Redux in this small app is considered an overkill because Redux takes a lot to setup. However, I decided to use it for scalibilty reasons. 

4- There are no test cases.
